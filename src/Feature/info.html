          <div>
            <p>
              It’s in the name. We do real development to solve real challenges.
              This isn’t a tutorial hell workshop, where you constantly watch a
              bunch of videos all the time and label yourself a developer on
              LinkedIn.
            </p>
            <p>
              We don’t do unfinished hobby projects here. Our code is peer
              reviewed, improved and the open source work that you do here is
              displayed on your member’s profile.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are encouraged to show this profile to your potential
              recruiters, and this work is more credible because it’s deployed
              on production and has real users. You will learn debugging skills
              and improving performance and reliability of the products you make
              here.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will be given real challenges, which are always slightly
              outside your comfort zone and current skills, so that you keep
              getting better.

          <div>
            <p>
              Our main mentor and coach, <b>Ankush Dharkar</b>, has been
              teaching people to solve engineering challenges and code for a
              long time. He is himself a full-stack developer, with heavy
              expertise on Frontend UI engineering. He was involved with his own
              startup for more than 7 years, then worked at Disney+Hotstar, was
              an instructor at career accelerator at Pesto Tech, and currently
              working at Amazon.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will always be tracked for updates on our
              <b>status site</b>, and we periodically remove our inactive
              participants. So, rest assured, there’s no dead-weight.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will always have direction and goals on how to improve. You
              won’t be wasting time deciding what to build -- this is often a
              problem people don’t realize. People choose hobby projects they
              already know how to do. In real life, quite often you get new
              unforseen challenges. We prepare you to tackle them head-on.

          <div>
            <p>
              You will work with other smart developers, some of them who
              started with almost no knowledge of coding or development. The
              only thing that makes them successful is commitment, persistence
              and willingness to admit things they do not know and do something
              about it. If you stay shy and don’t participate, you will be the
              one at loss.
            </p>
            <p>
              All the members who you would work with, our highly active
              motivated and driven peer group that you can ask for. You may or
              may not have such a group at your workplace :)

          <div>
            <p>
              We share our experiences and knowledge, so you will learn far more
              and sooner than on your own. We pool and share our resources to
              ensure we are some of the best employees companies will come
              across.

          <div>
            <p>
              We are not a one-trick pony. We do projects in a lot of
              technologies, including standard web technologies like HTML, CSS,
              JavaScript, React, Ember, Vue, Node, Go, Rust, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              We don’t limit ourselves to one thing. We focus on building
              amazing basic foundations and then adapting and learning whatever
              tech or tool we have to in order to engineer the best solutions to
              problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are engineers and problem solvers, not the kind of people who
              will become outdated with time.
            </p>

          <div>
            <p>
              Being successful in career is much more than just knowing how to
              push keys and click around. We ensure that you are the kind of
              person who is great at communitcation skills: Both Written and
              Spoken.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are ourselves a fun group, who believe in helping each other.
              You will have a good time!
